The frontend will be a reflection of WP database delivered by Rust.
Theme name = WP site title
Templates = "template" post type items
Theme creation involves the following steps:
- creating a new wp-content folder
- creating a new theme? I don't think so
- creating a new database for that theme

- bundle PHP? 


- CPT builder (physical & virtual)
- initial theme choice
- Known plugins support (through virtual CPT definition as shortcuts)
- forms?
- remove unnecessary Elementor options & links
- treeshake CSS (https://wpspeedmatters.com/remove-unused-css-from-wordpress/, https://purgecss.com/plugins/postcss.html#usage, https://github.com/purifycss/purifycss)
gather all stylesheets used
if only once, make a separate file and enqueue for specific template
else, store in styles.css and make it loaded

per page: treeshake
globally: merge and remove duplicate
- treeshake JS?
- components import (drag & drop of WP extensions/PHP files)
